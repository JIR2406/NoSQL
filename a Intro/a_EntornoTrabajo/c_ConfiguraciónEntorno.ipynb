    "## Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "**The terminal** is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with their computer's operating system by typing commands. It provides direct access to the systemâ€™s shell, which interprets and executes commands. The terminal is commonly used for tasks like navigating the file system, running scripts, managing processes, and configuring system settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the terminal operates entirely through text commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shell Integration:** The terminal runs a shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh, PowerShell) that processes user commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automation:** Commands can be scripted for automation using shell scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Remote Access:** It can be used to connect to remote servers via SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency:** Many tasks can be performed faster with commands compared to GUI-based interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shells depend on the operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Windows, (Linux, Mac):** [PowerShell][PS], [cheatsheet][CSHT]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mac / Linux:** [Bash][BSH], [zsh][ZSH]\n",
    "\n",
    "> **In Jupyter Notebooks, we can execute a shell command by placing an exclamation mark (!) before the command.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ejemplo: \n",
    "> * ```pwd``` The pwd (print working directory) command displays the path of the current working directory in the terminal.\n",
